title: "Page Rewrite for 2026"
intro: "When I first built this website I was a very green frontend developer curious to learn all of the \"grown up\" technologies like tailwind and react. Now I am using these tools for work and have realized not only all the ways I did so very stupidly all these years ago but also that it doesen't really spark joy to work with. Trying out a pallete cleanser using Astro for \"content driven\" development and pico.css to just not have to mess around with design unless I really want to."
